# Blockchain-based E-waste Tracking System (BETS)
E-waste management system tracking the product lifecycle from inception to end-of-life via Web3 and React to enhance system capabilities.

## Problem Statement
Every year, a significant amount of electronic devices become obsolete, contributing to the growing e-waste problem. Improper management of e-waste can have detrimental effects on the environment and human health. Current methods of e-waste management often lack transparency and accountability, making it challenging to track the lifecycle of electronic products and ensure responsible disposal and recycling practices.

## Solution
The 'EWaste Management' project proposes the use of blockchain technology to revolutionize e-waste management. By creating a decentralized platform, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, consumers, refurbishers, recyclers, and governmental and environmental agencies can interact and track the lifecycle of electronic products effectively. Each entity in the supply chain can perform specific actions such as 'Sell', 'Give', 'Dispose', or 'Return', ensuring transparency and accountability at every stage of the product lifecycle.

## Accomplishments
1. Developed a holistic e-waste management system addressing the product lifecycle from inception to end-of-life.
2. Achieved seamless integration of Web3 with React, enhancing system capabilities.
3. Created an adaptive and user-friendly UI/UX design, ensuring a satisfying user experience.
4. Implemented robust data capturing mechanisms for accurate tracking without compromising usability.
5. Established granular transaction rights for stakeholders, enhancing system depth and customization.

## Functionality

### Blockchain Core
Utilizing a decentralized ledger, the project records the lifecycle of electronic devices, ensuring traceability and transparency.

### Entity Transactions
Stakeholders such as manufacturers and consumers have distinct functionalities, enabling actions like 'Sell', 'Return', or 'Dispose' based on their role in the supply chain.

### ML Insights
Machine Learning algorithms analyze e-waste data to predict product lifespans and forecast e-waste generation, aiding in waste management planning.

### Regulatory Oversight
Governmental and environmental agencies can monitor transactions, ensuring compliance with e-waste regulations and standards.

### Sustainability Metrics
By integrating blockchain data and ML insights, the project provides key sustainability metrics, guiding optimized e-waste strategies.

## Development Process
#### Frontend Development
Implemented using React.js, providing a responsive interface for users to interact with the system.

#### Blockchain Integration
Utilized Web3.js to connect the frontend to the Ethereum blockchain, enabling transparent tracking of electronic device lifecycles.

#### Smart Contracts
Developed using Solidity, ensuring secure and immutable record-keeping for transactions.

#### Machine Learning Insights
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on e-waste data using Google Colab, guiding prediction algorithms for waste management.

#### Backend Services
Utilized Node.js for server-side operations, interfacing with the blockchain and serving the frontend.

#### Database Management
Ensured robust storage and retrieval of non-blockchain data for efficient system operation.

#### Security Measures
Employed cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and ensure data privacy.

## Challenges Faced
- Integrating Web3 with React for seamless blockchain integration.
- Balancing UI/UX design decisions for an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
- Designing advanced forms for detailed data capture while maintaining usability.
- Troubleshooting configurations such as 'tsconfig.json' for system stability.
- Implementing nuanced transaction rights for different stakeholders while ensuring system integrity.
- Integrating machine learning insights derived from EDA into the main platform seamlessly.
